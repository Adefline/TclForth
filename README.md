TclForth is a Forth system that uses Tcl/Tk as its native language. The Forth source code is compiled to Tcl procedures for execution in the Tcl run time system. Tcl commands and Forth words coexist as a symbiosis of Tcl and Forth. TclForth applications run unchanged wherever Tcl runs, e.g. Windows, OS-X and Linux.


The TclForth system is presently available at https://code.google.com/p/tclforth. It will move to Github soon.
